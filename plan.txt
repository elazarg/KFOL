Plan: Three-Level Factoring of K-FOL to Match MPST
0. Motivation
We want to justify the claim:

“The ‘protocol half’ of K-FOL is the same thing, up to encoding, as MPST local projections; the ‘payoff half’ is the extra structure K-FOL adds on top.”
To make that defensible, the objects compared on both sides must forget payoffs to the same degree.
1. Start from the shape of a K-FOL formula
A K-FOL formula is fundamentally of the form:

[

\Phi ;=; \underbrace{\text{Prefix}}{\text{linear, player-tagged, visibility-aware script}} ;+; \underbrace{\text{Terminal}}{\langle \fo_0,\dots,\fo_{K-1} \rangle}.

]
So: (Script, Goal-Tuple).
2. Define three KFOL-side projections
We introduce three levels, not two.

(a) Pure script view
[

\Script_i(\Phi)

]

This is the purely structural, purely forgetful per-participant view:
keep the linear order of moves,
keep, for each move, who performs it,
keep the visibility / slash information as it affects (i),
drop the terminal entirely,
drop even the fact that (i) had a goal.
Result: “What does participant (i) do/see in this interaction?” — nothing about winning.
This is the KFOL thing that is on the same level as MPST local projection.
(b) Goal extraction
[

\Goal_i(\Phi) ;:=; \fo_i

]

This just picks the (i)-th component of the terminal K-tuple. No protocol structure, just “what would (i) like?”
(c) Semantic refinement (the original one)
[

\AdvOp_i(\Phi) ;=; \Force\bigl(\Script_i(\Phi), \Goal_i(\Phi)\bigr)

]

i.e. “given this script (which constrains information) and this goal, can (i) force it against all other strategies?”
This makes explicit what was previously bundled together.
3. MPST side
You already have

[

\mathcal T : \KFOL \to \text{GlobalMPST}

]

that erases goals and keeps the script.
Then MPST gives you the usual local projection:

[

(\mathcal T(\Phi)) \upharpoonright_i

]

which is, again, just the script for participant (i).
So on the MPST side we also have a “pure script for (i)”.
4. The commuting square that actually works
Now we can state the defensible square:
[

\begin{array}{ccc}

\KFOL & \xrightarrow{;\mathcal T;} & \text{GlobalMPST} \

\Big\downarrow{\Script_i} & & \Big\downarrow{(\cdot)\upharpoonright_i} \

\text{Per-Player Script} & \xrightarrow{;\cong;} & \text{Local MPST for } i

\end{array}

]
Left-down: forget everything but the script relevant to (i).
Top-right-down: translate to MPST, then project locally.
Bottom arrow: “these two are the same kind of object.”
This works because both paths now forget the goal.
5. Where the goal tuple lives
Once the structural square is established, you say:

“KFOL ≠ MPST, because KFOL also has (\Goal_i(\Phi)) for every (i).”
“This extra K-tuple of goals is what lets us define (\AdvOp_i) / forceability, i.e. game-theoretic judgments on top of the same protocol skeleton.”
So the contribution is positioned as:

Protocol layer (validated by the commuting square with MPST).
Payoff layer (new, KFOL-only).
Game-semantic layer (forceability over 1+2).
6. Coalitions / participant partitions (optional but consistent)
If we need fewer participants than K, we first fix a surjection

[

\pi : {0,\dots,K-1} \twoheadrightarrow {A_1,\dots,A_m}

]

and apply your existing coalition projection on the KFOL side to get a formula with one goal per participant.
Then we run the same square with (A_j) instead of (i). It’s the same pattern, just after grouping.
7. How to present it in the paper
You can literally write:

“Every K-FOL specification splits into a protocol part and a payoff part.

(i) The protocol part, when viewed from one participant, coincides with MPST local projection.

(ii) The payoff part is retained only on the K-FOL side, enabling game-theoretic reasoning (forceability, coalitions).

Therefore K-FOL extends, rather than replaces, the MPST style.”
