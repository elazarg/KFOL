abstract = {We develop an interpretation of linear type theory as dependent session types for a term passing extension of the pi-calculus. The type system allows us to express rich constraints on sessions, such as interface contracts and proof-carrying certification, which go beyond existing session type systems, and are here justified on purely logical grounds. We can further refine our interpretation using proof irrelevance to eliminate communication overhead for proofs between trusted parties. Our technical results include type preservation and global progress, which in our setting naturally imply compliance to all properties declared in interface contracts expressed by dependent types.},

abstract = {Program slicing is a method used by experienced computer programmers for abstracting from programs. Starting from a subset of a program's behavior, slicing reduces that program to a minimal form which still produces that behavior. The reduced program, called a “slice”, is an independent program guaranteed to faithfully represent the original program within the domain of the specified subset of behavior.Finding a slice is in general unsolvable. A dataflow algorithm is presented for approximating slices when the behavior subset is specified as the values of a set of variables at a statement. Experimental evidence is presented that these slices are used by programmers during debugging. Experience with two automatic slicing tools is summarized. New measures of program complexity are suggested based on the organization of a program's slices.},
