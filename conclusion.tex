\label{sec:conclusion}
We have presented \KFOL, a symmetric $K$-player calculus with a minimal,
prenex core and a $K=2$ specialization that is algebraically rich and
serves as a retract of classical \FOL. By internalizing player roles,
vectorized outcomes, and explicit $S_K$ symmetry, the calculus
provides a foundation for analyzing multi-agent games. We extended this
core with IF-style binders, which raises the complexity of the
forceability problem from PSPACE-complete to NEXPTIME-hard,
and allows the logic to syntactically capture information constraints.

Future work includes a deeper study of the K-player complement
operator, developing a full proof theory, and combining this work with other axes such as probabilistic reasoning.

An open question is whether \KFOL can serve as a full semantic model for a K-player fragment of linear logic. This would involve defining an 'abstraction' function from multi-party linear propositions back to \KFOL games and proving that the cut operation in the logic corresponds to game composition.
